# Members-Only

This is a project from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/s://www.theodinproject.com/),
a web curriculum for learning web development.

In this project I build a Rails 5.2.4 app that allows Members of the site to
compose embarassing posts about non-members. Additionally only these members can
see who wrote the posts, while others can only guess, or also register for the
site. :)
